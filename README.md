Start by navigating to https://editor.swagger.io/ and inspect the Swagger Petstore example.


Now, inspect the example in [`minitwit_api_spec.yaml`](minitwit_api_spec.yaml), either by copying it into the editor at https://editor.swagger.io/ or by editing it in such an editor that you run locally (access it on http://localhost/ after running the followig):

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:8080 --rm swaggerapi/swagger-editor
```

For other ways of installing and running the editor, see https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-editor/.
